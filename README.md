Very Avid Forsaken fan, No i do not entirely read the lore on some parts of this fandom. 

I am German, No i do not care if you make nazi jokes around me. Just tone it down a bit depending if i am having it or not.

I am Autistic, Meaning i can get hyper very easily. I do go silent at times depending on situation as i can not understand tone at times depending on mood.

I fictkin alot of characters, Coping links, Etc. My heavy kins are just characters i hyperfixate more on. 

Yes im 14, I am not as sensitive and i do not get uncomfortable with alot of things beside NSFW ! Please do not mention NSFW Heavily around me.

Before interacting with me, Keep in mind i have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Meaning i cannot start conversations normally.

I do however, Allow cuddles. Or people to sit with me. Though i do get annoyed when someone covers me. It is apart of my boundaries.

When i get comfy with someone, I tend to be very talkative and annoying. If it gets too much, Please tell me to tone it down ! Otherwise i will not know at all.

I am not a confrontational person, And i am not willing to have another relationship due to the fact ive had bad relationships in the past !

I tend to be very silent at first !
