Before interacting with me, Keep in mind i have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Meaning i cannot start conversations normally.

I do however, Allow cuddles. Or people to sit with me. Though i do get annoyed when someone covers me. It is apart of my boundaries.

When i get comfy with someone, I tend to be very talkative and annoying. If it gets too much, Please tell me to tone it down ! Otherwise i will not know at all.

I am not a confrontational person, And i am not willing to have another relationship due to the fact ive had bad relationships in the past !

I tend to be very silent at first !
